# Login_Errors

I have created another login form with different validation in React.js

In this project user would see below validations on submitting the form:

a. if name is empty then it will show 'name is required'


b. if name is less than 2 characters then it will show error 'enter atleast 2 characters'


c. if email is empty then it will show error with 'please enter email'


d. if email format isinvalid then it will show error message with 'email is invalid'


e. if password is empty then it will show error message with please enter your password


f.  if password is less than of 8 characters then it will show error message 'password should be of 8 characters'
